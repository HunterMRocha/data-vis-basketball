			<h1>Data Analytics in Basketball</h1>
			<h3 class="container">
				Description: <br>
				Basketball statistics are typically analyzed and presented as summaries, either of a game, 
				season, player, or some entity. My analysis begins from the observation that basketball is a game of context. 
				The same outcome on a given play can have radically different meanings for the outcome of a game depending on the context. 
				I will seek to understand on a more contextual level by visually analyzing the game. Specifically, 
				I want to be able to answer the following: <br>
				<ol>
					<li>What is the most efficient way to run an offense?</li>
					<li>Where do different players shoot best at? </li>
					<li>How do different offenses stack up against each other, from an efficiency perspective?</li>
				</ol>
			
				
				By answering these questions users will learn how data analytics can be the difference between winning and losing. 
				By visualizing different offenses users will be able to compare different players and teams against each other, 
				and how they stack up against each other. These objectives are going to be met in the Features section 
				because users will be able to see a visual representation of individual players shot selection, in addition to teams as a whole. 
				By isolating a player's shot selection users will be able to visualize different strengths and weaknesses from a player and a team.
